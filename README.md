#Brain Tumor Classification using MRI Images
Overview
This project aims to classify MRI images of the brain to predict the presence and type of tumor using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset sourced from [insert link to dataset], consisting of [insert number] MRI images labeled with tumor types.

Dataset Description
The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found [here](insert link to dataset). It contains [insert number] MRI images of the brain along with corresponding labels indicating the presence and type of tumor. Preprocessing steps including resizing and normalization were applied to standardize the images.

Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of [insert number] layers, including convolutional and pooling layers. Details of the architecture can be found in the provided code repository.

Training Procedure
The model was trained using [insert optimizer], with a batch size of [insert batch size] and for [insert number] epochs. Data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the diversity of the training set.

Evaluation Metrics
The model was evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric, achieving an accuracy of [insert accuracy] on the test set.
